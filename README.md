Module 21 Challenge!

Our second last challenge. I don't think I will end up doing challenge 22, but I will attempt challenge 6.

Despite being requested to move to Google Collab, ultimately I have the processing power and time to simply remain on local. I just copied the existing file and editted for optimization.

I used significant quantites of snippets from class assignments.
